# Stargate
{: .no_toc }

If you don't know what stargate is, 
check [Whatâ€™s that Stargate thing anyway?]({{ '/what-is-stargate/' | absolute_url }})

## Natural Generation
Stargates generate only in pre-defined dimensions.
Generation in other dimensions can be achieved with datapacks. 

[//]: # (TODO: add link to generation datapacks)

There are two Stargates in the **Overworld**.

**Lore:**  
The first gate (**Beta gate**), originally built on Earth by the Ancients,
was buried in ice for thousands of years in Antarctica.
The SG-1 discovered this gate after the first gate in Egypt,
hence the Beta gate.
The gate found in Giza, Egypt, was the second Earth's Stargate
brought by the Goa'uld System Lord Ra.
it was the first gate found (in 1928)
and operated by [SGC](https://www.gateworld.net/wiki/Stargate_Command), 
hence the Alpha gate.


The **Alpha gate** is buried in-game with a seal 
and can be found with an archeologist's help ([Survival Guide / Finding a Stargate]({{ '/survival/finding-gate' | absolute_url }})).

![Stargate buried with seal in desert]({{ '/assets/img/structures/gate_buried_desert.png' | absolute_url }})
{: .max-width-768 }

The **Beta gate** can be found in a cave.
To find it, dial your stargate to a different dimension and remove the DHD from your stargate in the overworld.
That way, the Beta gate in the cave will be the only gate in the overworld 
and will **take priority** once you dial back to the overworld.
However, that will only work when the **Beta gate** structure was already generated.

If you end up again in your stargate, there is a second option.
Travel to other StargateJourney dimension (Abydos, Chulak or a different one).
Note the coordinates (X and Z can be displayed by pressing `F3`) 
of the stargate in the other dimension, and visit the same coordinates in the overworld.
Remember that you need to dig. 
You are looking for a cave with the beta stargate.
Also, don't forget the DHD that is in the cave with the gate.

# Stargate
{: .no_toc }

## Generation
By default, two Stargates generate in the Overworld and then one Stargate generates in each of the Dimensions added by Stargate Journey. Other Dimensions like Nether and End are still reachable through the Stargate Network, but they do not have their own Stargates by default.

## Symbols
Stargates use Addresses to dial other Stargates. These Addresses are formed by Symbols and while there dozens upon dozens of Symbols in the mod, all of them fit under one of these two categories:

### Regular Symbols
Regular Symbols are Symbols numbered 1, 2, 3,... which actually form an Address. Different Solar Systems will generaly share regular Symbols if they're located in the same Galaxy. Even though different Galaxies may use different sets of Symbols, those Symbols still represent numbers starting from 1, 2, 3,... and as such, they will work the exact same way in different Galaxies.

### Point Of Origin
The Point of Origin is a special kind of symbol with the number 0. Each Solar System usually has a unique Point Of Origin representing it (Though they may look different, all of them share the number 0).

## Natural Generation
Only one Stargate will generate per dimension by default(the only exception to this is Overworld, which will generate 2 Stargates in the form of a Buried Stargate and a Stargate Pedestal), however, this can be changed with the use of datapacks.

## Variants

### Universe Stargate
* Generation: 1
* Only has 36 Symbols (Can't dial Symbols above 35)
* Always has the same set of Symbols, that being the Universal Symbols.

### Milky Way Stargate
* Generation: 2
* Only has 39 Symbols (Can't dial Symbols above 38)
* Can be dialed Manually: [Manual Dialing Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/survival/dialing/#manual-dialing-with-redstone)
* When first placed, the Stargate will adapt the set of Symbols belonging to the Solar System it was placed in uses. It will remember those Symbols when broken.

### Pegasus Stargate
* Generation: 3
* Only displays 36 Symbols at a time, but can actually dial any Symbol
* When placed, it will use the set of Symbols belonging to the Solar System it is currently in. When broken and placed in another Solar System, it will switch to that Solar System's Symbols.

## Feedback Codes
Whenever Stargate performs any action that may succeed or fail, it will return a Feedback Code, which may be used to better understand what caused the success or failure. The codes are return in the form of an integer, with error codes being negative integers and success codes being positive.

* `0` NONE

### Success Codes
* `1` SYMBOL_ENCODED
* `2` CONNECTION_ESTABILISHED_SYSTEM_WIDE
* `3` CONNECTION_ESTABILISHED_INTERSTELLAR
* `4` CONNECTION_ESTABILISHED_INTERGALACTIC

* `8` CONNECTION_ENDED_BY_POINT_OF_ORIGIN
* `9` CONNECTION_ENDED_BY_NETWORK
* `10` CONNECTION_ENDED_BY_AUTOCLOSE
* `11` CHEVRON_RAISED

### Error Codes

# Stargate Variants
{: .no_toc }
[Datapacks]({{ site.baseurl }}/datapacks) are able to add custom Stargate variants.  
These variants are available in the base mod.  
To change the gate variant, you need a [Stargate variant crystal]({{ site.baseurl }}/items/crystals/#stargate-variant-crystals).

{: .future }
It is planned to distinguish the variant crystals for different Stargates.

## Classic Stargate

Initially inspired by mod [SGCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sg-craft).

### Movie
`milkyway_movie`

Chevrons do not glow.
