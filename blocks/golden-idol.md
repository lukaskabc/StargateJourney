## Golden Idol
A precious relic left behind by
Goa'ulds - _an ancient and powerful race whose temples now lie buried in the forgotten corners of the world._

The idol cannot be crafted, it can only be found in the [Goa'uld temples]({{ '/structures/goauld-temples/' | absolute_url }}).
There is a single golden idol in each temple.
Optionally it can be generated as a loot in a spawner room in the abandoned desert pyramid.

Can be used to make an [archeology table]({{ '/blocks/archeology-table/' | absolute_url }}) or sold to an [archaeologist villager]({{ '/blocks/archeology-table/#archeologist-villager' | absolute_url }}) for emeralds.
