# Survival Guide
{: .no_toc }

Stargate Journey aims to replicate the exploration aspect of the [Stargate franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate).
That is why you won't be able to create Stargates immediately.
You will have to find and learn to make them along the way.

The guide will take you through [locating the Stargate]({{ '/survival/finding-gate' | absolute_url }}), 
[dialing it]({{ '/survival/dialing' | absolute_url }}) for the first time, 
[finding more addresses]({{ '/survival/addresses' | absolute_url }}), and traveling to other worlds. 
Finally, you will [process resources]({{ '/survival/naquadah' | absolute_url }}) from different planets, generate power and [build your Stargate]({{ '/survival/end-game' | absolute_url }}).

{: .note }
We will try our best to provide **hints** on how to proceed through the mod.
And yet not reveal how it works behind the scenes and what the structures look like.
**Spoilers** will be in **collapsible sections**,
so **it's up to you** if you want to see them,
or you'll **enjoy the moment** when you find them for the first time in the game.

{: .future }
This wiki was written with Stargate Journey version `0.6.39`.  
It is planned that the survival progression will change in the future.

## [Begin with finding a Stargate]({{ '/survival/finding-gate' | absolute_url }})
