# Finding addresses
{: .no_toc }

As you already know from your trip to Abydos ([Survival Guide / Dialing]({{ '/survival/dialing/' | absolute_url}})), 
you need an address to connect to another Stargate.
Addresses of other worlds can be found on Abydos and Chulak.

<details markdown="block" id="locate-command">
<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> A cheat way to find the address using a command</summary>

To get the address of a solar system in the current galaxy:
```
/sgjourney stargateNetwork address <dimension>
```
{: .width-fit-content }

Or to get the extra-galactic address for a solar system in a different galaxy:
```
/sgjourney stargateNetwork extragalacticAddress <dimension>
```
{: .width-fit-content }

</details>

[//]: # (TODO: add link to address list and where they can be found)

## Abydos cartouche

Abydos is a planet under [Ra](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Ra)'s control, a Goa'uld System Lord.

The structures housing **cartouches** on Abydos look like **sandstone rock formation**.
You can find these scattered around the vast Abydos desert.

Each cartouche structure contains 5 addresses.
The first address is always the address of Earth.
The next two addresses leads to other planets under Ra's control and possibly to Chulak.
The last two addresses leads to other dimensions from vanilla and those added by other mods.

There is a small opening, which you can use to get inside.

Once inside, the first cartouche holds the Earth's address.

**Four more cartouches behind that blocked-off entrance to the left.**

## Chulak cartouche
Chulak, on the other hand, is under the control of another Goa'uld System Lord - [Apophis](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Apophis).

The **cartouche** structure on Chulak is a formation of several small stone pillars in a circle.
It can contain addresses to other planets under Apophis' control, the Abydos and vanilla or other modded dimensions.
