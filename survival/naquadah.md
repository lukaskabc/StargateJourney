{: .no_toc }

> Naquadah is a rare, super-heavy, super-dense chemical element.  
> Due to its unique properties, Naquadah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; 
> the Stargates themselves are composed almost entirely of Naquadah.
> Weapons-grade Naquadah is so dense and heavy 
> that 2 Jaffa are required to lift a quantity the size of a couple of common housing bricks, 
> making it at least as dense as gold. 
> Alternate forms of Naquadah include Liquid Naquadah, used to power Goa'uld Staff weapons.

In Stargate Journey, Naquadah is the **primary resource** for further progression.

## Obtaining Naquadah

[Naquadah ore]({{ '/blocks/ores/#naquadah-ore' | absolute_url }}) can generate in the Nether, Abydos and Rima.
On Abydos, it can be found underground or in the **Abydos spires biome**.

Mining the ore drops **raw Naquadah** and rarely **pure Naquadah**.
The chance can be increased with [Fortune](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fortune) enchantment.

## Processing Naquadah

**Raw Naquadah** can be crafted into **Naquadah Alloy**.
Fired into **Refined Naquadah** in the blasting furnace.
Liquidized in the Naquadah liquidizer into **Liquid Naquadah**, and **Heavy liquid Naquadah**.
And the **Pure Naquadah** can be processed into **Weapons grade Naquadah** in the blast furnace.

Naquadah can then be used to craft crystals, tools, weapons, and even your own Stargate.
