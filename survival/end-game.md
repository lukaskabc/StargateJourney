# End game
{: .no_toc }

Since now, you have access to Naquadah sources on the Abydos and Rima, 
you can create your own Stargate.

## Creating a Stargate
First, you must build a Classic Stargate that can be later upgraded to other type.  
To build a Classic Stargate, you will need the following:
- **&ensp;1x** Classic Stargate Base Block
- **&ensp;9x** Classic Stargate Chevron Blocks
- **14x** Classic Stargate Ring Blocks

{% minecraft_recipe_crafting item:"sgjourney:classic_stargate_base_block" %}
{% minecraft_recipe_crafting item:"sgjourney:classic_stargate_chevron_block" %}
{% minecraft_recipe_crafting item:"sgjourney:classic_stargate_ring_block" %}

With the mentioned blocks, you need to build this structure:

![Classic Stargate Block Structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/survival/classic_stargate_block_structure.png)
{: .max-width-512 }

Then, you can right-click the Classic Stargate Base Block with an empty hand, which will transform the structure into a Classic Stargate.
